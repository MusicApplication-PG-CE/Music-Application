Music Application PG-CE is a free and open-source application for the listening and downloading music. Made with Python and Pygame-CE (hence PG-CE), this application is made to be as lightweight in size and performance. It comes integrated with Itunes and Youtube Search with a custom search that ignores invasive snooping with cookies and such.
